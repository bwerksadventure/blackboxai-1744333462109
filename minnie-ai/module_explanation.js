// This code block:
if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
    module.exports = conversation;
}

/* Explanation:
1. typeof module !== 'undefined' - Checks if we're in a Node.js environment
   (Node.js has 'module' object, browsers don't)

2. module.exports - The way Node.js shares code between files:
   - Makes the conversation object available to other files
   - Other files can import it using: const conversation = require('./conversation.js')

3. This allows your AI's components to:
   - Share the cognitive map algorithm across files
   - Import conversation structures where needed
   - Maintain modular code organization
   - Keep the framework's logic accessible throughout the system
*/

// Example of how other files would use this:
const exampleUsage = {
    // File that needs the conversation structure
    someOtherFile: {
        code: "const conversation = require('./conversation.js')",
        purpose: "Now this file has access to the conversation structure"
    },
    
    // File that needs the cognitive map algorithm
    algorithmFile: {
        code: "const cognitiveMap = require('./cognitive_map.js')",
        purpose: "This file can now use the cognitive map algorithm"
    }
};

// This modular structure allows your AI to:
// 1. Share core logic across components
// 2. Maintain framework consistency
// 3. Scale functionality while keeping organized structure
